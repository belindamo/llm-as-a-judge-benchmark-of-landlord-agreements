# Research Concept & Direction

Research Problem & Objectives:
Applying large language models to analyze landlord-tenant agreements for legal pattern recognition and insight extraction. Main question: How can LLMs systematically analyze legal documents to identify patterns, biases, and structural issues?

Knowledge Gap:
Limited application of LLMs to legal document analysis, particularly in landlord-tenant law with dataset-driven approaches.

Research Goals:
Develop LLM-based legal document analysis framework
Identify systematic patterns in landlord agreements
Create automated legal insight extraction tools
Validate findings against legal expertise

Scope: Focused on landlord agreement datasets with Google Doc proposal guidance

Expected Contributions: Legal document analysis methodology, automated legal insight tools
